## Features

- **Video Selection**: Choose any video from your photo library
- **Video Trimming**: Trim your video to the perfect 3-5 second clip
- **Live Photo Conversion**: Automatically process your video into Apple's Live Photo format
- **Direct Photos Integration**: Save the Live Photo directly to your Photos library
- **Optimized Format**: Creates Live Photos with the correct metadata, dimensions, and specifications

## Requirements

- iOS 15.0+
- Xcode 14.0+
- Swift 5.0+

## How It Works

The app follows a multi-step process to ensure high-quality Live Photos:

1. **Video Selection**: Choose a video from your device's photo library
2. **Video Trimming**: Use the intuitive slider to select the perfect segment (max 5 seconds)
3. **Video Processing**:
   - Adjust video duration to ideal length
   - Convert to required frame rate
   - Optimize dimensions (1080Ã—1920)
   - Extract a still frame for the photo component
   - Add required metadata for Live Photo functionality
4. **Save**: The result is saved to your Photos library as a Live Photo

## Using Live Photos as Wallpapers

After creating your Live Photo:

1. Go to **Settings > Wallpaper > Choose New Wallpaper**
2. Tap on **"All Photos"** or **"Recents"**
3. Find your newly created Live Photo (it will be the most recent)
4. Set it as your Lock Screen
5. Press firmly on the Lock Screen to see your Live Wallpaper animate

## Technical Implementation

The app uses several advanced iOS technologies:

- **AVFoundation**: For video processing (trimming, scaling, frame extraction)
- **Photos Framework**: For Live Photo creation and library access
- **Core Image**: For image processing and format conversion
- **SwiftUI**: For the modern, responsive interface
- **Combine**: For reactive programming and state management

## Architecture

The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture:

- **Views**: SwiftUI views for UI components
- **ViewModels**: Coordinate between the UI and data processing
- **Utilities**: Handle complex video and image processing tasks
- **Extensions**: Add functionality to system types

## Key Components

- **WallpaperViewModel**: Central coordinator for video selection and processing
- **VideoProcessor**: Handles video trimming and export
- **LivePhotoUtil**: Handles the complex Live Photo creation process
- **Converter4Video**: Processes video for Live Photo compatibility
- **Converter4Image**: Handles still image component with required metadata
